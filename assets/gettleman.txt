The Giants GM addressed the star wide receiver, who reportedly has drawn interest from the Niners, during his season-ending press conference Wednesday morning.
"We didn't sign him to trade him, if that's what you're asking," Gettleman said, throwing cold water on resurfaced rumors.

When asked if that means Beckham will be with Big Blue next season, the GM added: "You heard what I said."
The three-time Pro Bowler has five years and $74 million remaining on the long-term deal he signed in August.
